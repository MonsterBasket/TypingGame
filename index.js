//-----list of features-----
//1. choose a theme
// - after choosing a theme, it will load a random background image from that theme 
// - from unsplash, and a list of words related to that theme

//2. playing the game
// - words will slowly start floating from right to left from the selected word list
// - starting slowly, and shorter words (3-5 letters).
// - as time progresses, words will appear faster and be longer in length

//3. scoring
// - additional points for correct letters, minus points for missing letters?
// - record accuracy (total correct / total typed) and longest streak

//4. high scores (optional)
// - save top scores to a server, just enter your name when you finish a round and make the top 10

//5. technical
// - handling specific event listeners is key.  Just copy Ztype's approach: when the first letter of
// - a word is pressed that locks the user onto that word until the word is complete - it may be as simple
// - as saving a reference to that word into a "target" variable?

//6. Next level
// - Every 3? levels the user can pick a new theme.  Three options will float around in the middle of the screen
// - user can't die on this stage (game is essentially paused) and there is no scoring.  Type the name of the
// - theme to choose, this will trigger a new background image and word list.
